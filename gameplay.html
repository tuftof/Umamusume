                    <h2>Career Mode</h2>
                    <p>Career Mode is the primary mode of play in Umamusume. Gameplay revolves 
                    around raising an Umamusume's stats and completing their career objectives. 
                    Players select one trainee Umamusume, two legacy Umamusume for Inspiration, 
                    and six support cards. Inspiration allows veteran Umamusume to act as Legacies 
                    with the ability to pass down Sparks correlating to aptitudes, stat bonuses, 
                    and skill hints to the trainee. Support cards dictate additional stat bonuses, 
                    ingame events, and the additional skills that can be acquired.</p>

                    <h2>Team Trials</h2>
                    <p>Team Trials is a PvP game mode in which you create teams of Umamusume 
                    and race against other players' teams. A Team Trials team consists of 
                    15 Umamusume, with 3 Umamusume designated for each race type. These 
                    race types are Sprint, Mile, Medium, Long, and Dirt. Sprint, Mile, 
                    Medium, and Long are turf surface races. The Dirt race type in Team 
                    Trials is always a mile distance race on the dirt surface. Players are 
                    matched against other teams close to their team rank. Each match is 
                    made up of 5 races, one of each race type.

                    <p>Every day, you can participate in 3 races that provide Monies or 
                        Support Points. There are two races with three difficulty levels 
                        each: easy, normal, and hard. Higher difficulties provide better 
                        rewards, so make sure to compete in the highest difficulty you can 
                        win to maximize your currencies!
